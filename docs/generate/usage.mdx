Protobuf has a large barrier to entry for developers new to IDL development. Not
only do you need to learn and understand the Protobuf language specification and
all of its nuances, you must also learn the complexity of `protoc`. The
`buf generate` command simplifies this experience so that Protobuf developers
can stop worrying about complex `protoc` invocations and instead focus on their
schema definitions.

## Configuration

The [`buf.gen.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md) template file controls
how the `buf generate` command executes `protoc` plugins for any
[input](../reference/inputs.md). The `buf.gen.yaml` template lists one or more
plugins and, optionally, other file option configurations with
[managed mode](managed-mode.md). For more information on the `buf.gen.yaml`
configuration, see the [reference](../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md).

## Define a module

To get started, create a [module](../bsr/overview.mdx#modules) by adding a
[`buf.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-yaml.md) file to the root of the directory
that contains your Protobuf definitions. You can create the default `buf.yaml`
file with this command:

```terminal
$ buf mod init
```

```diff title="buf.yaml"
version: v1
breaking:
  use:
    - FILE
lint:
  use:
    - DEFAULT
```

## Use Local Plugins

The `buf.gen.yaml` file is used to define a **local plugin template** that
works directly with the `buf generate` command. In short, the `buf.gen.yaml`
file is used to easily generate code with `protoc` plugins and simplifies the
`protoc` experience significantly.

### Create a `buf.gen.yaml`

Now that you have an [input](../reference/inputs.md) to generate code for, we
need to define a `buf.gen.yaml` and specify what `protoc` plugins you want to
use. For example, here's a typical `buf.gen.yaml` for
[go](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go) and
[grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/), assuming `protoc-gen-go` and
`protoc-gen-go-grpc` are on your `$PATH`:

```diff title="buf.gen.yaml"
version: v1
plugins:
  - plugin: go
    out: gen/go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  - plugin: go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - require_unimplemented_servers=false
```

By default, `buf generate` looks for a file of this shape named `buf.gen.yaml`
in your current directory. This can be thought of as a template for the set of
plugins you want to invoke.

Plugins are invoked in the order they are specified in the template, but each
plugin has a per-directory parallel invocation, with results from each
invocation combined before writing the result. For more information, see the
[`buf.gen.yaml` reference](../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md).

### Run generate

Run this to generate from the [input](../reference/inputs.md) in your current
directory:

```terminal
$ buf generate
```

You can also run `buf generate` on an input by specifying the filepath to the
directory containing the root of your `.proto` definitions. For example if all
of your `.proto` files are in directory `foo`:

```terminal
$ buf generate foo
```

The `buf generate` command will:

- Discovers all Protobuf files per your `buf.yaml` configuration.
- Copies the Protobuf files into memory.
- Compiles all Protobuf files.
- Executes the configured `plugins` according to each `strategy`.

Any errors are printed out in a `file:line:column:message` format by default.
For example:

```terminal
$ buf generate
---
acme/pet/v1/pet.proto:5:8:acme/payment/v1alpha1/payment.proto: does not exist
```

Generate output can also be printed as JSON:

```terminal
$ buf generate --error-format=json
---
{"path":"acme/pet/v1/pet.proto","start_line":5,"start_column":8,"end_line":5,"end_column":8,"type":"COMPILE","message":"acme/payment/v1alpha1/payment.proto: does not exist"}
```

## Use Remote Plugins

Stop worrying about how to install your plugins at specific versions and keep
this consistent across your team, let us take care of that.
[**Remote plugins**](../bsr/remote-plugins/usage.mdx) make it
possible to generate source code using remote plugins in an isolated environment
on the BSR. By isolating code generation from its environment, you eliminate an
entire class of problems caused by subtle differences across specific compiler
versions and custom Protobuf plugins.

You won't need the locally generated code from before, so you can remove the `gen` directory:

```sh
rm -rf gen
```

### Modify your `buf.gen.yaml`

Now that you have defined a `buf.gen.yaml` and specified what `protoc` plugins
you want to use. We can now modify the `buf.gen.yaml` for
[go](https://buf.build/protocolbuffers/go) and
[grpc](https://buf.build/grpc/go), remote plugins so `protoc-gen-go` and
`protoc-gen-go-grpc` do not need to be in your `$PATH`:

```diff title="buf.gen.yaml" {3,4,7,8}
version: v1
plugins:
-   - plugin: go
+   - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.28.1
      out: gen/go
      opt: paths=source_relative
-   - plugin: go-grpc
+   - plugin: buf.build/grpc/go:v1.2.0
      out: gen/go
      opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - require_unimplemented_servers=false
```

### Run generate

Run this to generate from the [input](../reference/inputs.md) in your current
directory:

```terminal
$ buf generate
```

The `buf generate` command will

- Discover all Protobuf files per your `buf.yaml` configuration.
- Send the Protobuf files to the Buf Schema Registry for remote plugins and
respond with your desired source code.

## Common use cases

The most common use case is to generate using the current directory as
[input](../reference/inputs.md):

```terminal
$ buf generate
```

This command assumes that a
[`buf.gen.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md) exists in the directory
where you run the command.

### Generating from a Buf module {#from-module}

You can generate from a Buf [module](../bsr/overview.mdx#modules) on the
[Buf Schema Registry](../bsr/introduction.md) (BSR) by providing the module name
as the [input](../reference/inputs.md):

```terminal
$ buf generate buf.build/acme/petapis
```

> This examples uses a Buf module as the input, but other inputs are available.
> For a complete list, see the
> [Buf input format documentation](../reference/inputs.md#source-formats).

### Generating using multiple templates {#multiple-templates}

The [`buf.gen.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md) file enables you to
configure one generation template. For cases where you need to use multiple
templates for the same [input](../reference/inputs.md), we recommend using
multiple configuration files with different names.

If you needed to use one template for Go and a different template for Java, for
example, you could create a `buf.gen.go.yaml` file and a `buf.gen.java.yaml`
file and use separate commands to generate code:

```terminal
$ buf generate --template buf.gen.go.yaml
$ buf generate --template buf.gen.java.yaml
```

You could also specify those different templates as JSON:

```terminal
$ buf generate --template '{"version":"v1","plugins":[{"plugin":"go","out":"gen/go"}]}'
$ buf generate --template '{"version":"v1","plugins":[{"plugin":"java","out":"gen/java"}]}'
```

### Generating to a specific directory {#output}

You can generate to a specific output directory using the `--output` or `-o`
flag. This command generates to the `bar/` directory while prepending `bar/` to
the `out` directives in the template:

```terminal
$ buf generate https://github.com/foo/bar.git --template data/generate.yaml -o bar
```

The paths in the template and the `-o` flag are interpreted as relative to your
**current directory**, so you can place your template files anywhere.

### Limit to specific files

By default, `buf` builds all files under the `buf.yaml` configuration file. You
can instead manually specify the file or directory paths to build. This is an
advanced feature intended to be used for editor or
[Bazel](/build-systems/bazel.md) integration - it is better to let `buf`
discover all files under management and handle this for you in general.

If you only want to generate stubs for a subset of your input, you can do so via
the `--path` flag:

```terminal title="Only generate for the files in the directories proto/foo and proto/bar"
$ buf generate --path proto/foo --path proto/bar
```

```terminal title="Only generate for the files proto/foo/foo.proto and proto/foo/bar.proto"
$ buf generate --path proto/foo/foo.proto --path proto/foo/bar.proto
```

```terminal title="Only generate for the files in the directory proto/foo on your GitHub repository"
$ buf generate https://github.com/foo/bar.git --template data/generate.yaml --path proto/foo
```

### Limit to specific types

The `buf generate` output is generated code for the types defined in your Protobuf
file(s). These can be messages, enums, or even RPC services and methods (if you are
using a plugin that supports RPC frameworks).

By default, `buf` generates code for **all** types in your source file(s).
But you can request `buf` only generate the types which you absolutely need,
omitting everything else from the generated output.

This can be achieved by specifying a list of types you want to include in the
`buf.gen.yaml`. All names must be fully-qualified. If any name is unknown, the
request will fail and no output will be returned. The resulting schema contains
these elements and all of their dependencies. Other types will be excluded from the
resulting generated code.

When a message is included, any type references therein, such as from fields that
refer to other message or enum types, are also included. If any included message
is extendable (proto2-only feature), its known extensions will be included.

If a particular method is included, its request and response message types will
also be included, but other methods that belong to the same service will not
(unless they are also included). If a service is included, all of its methods
(and their request and response types) are included.

If any included types have custom options the definitions for those custom options
will also be included.

If you only want to generate code for a subset of your types, you can
do so via the `buf.gen.yaml`:

```diff title="buf.gen.yaml"
version: v1
+types:
+  include:
+    - buf.alpha.lint.v1.IDPaths
plugins:
  - plugin: go
    out: gen/go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  - plugin: go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - require_unimplemented_servers=false
```

You can also use the `--include-types` flag, which overrides whatever might
be configured in `buf.gen.yaml`.

```terminal title="Only generate the type with a fully qualified name of buf.alpha.lint.v1.IDPaths"
$ buf generate --include-types buf.alpha.lint.v1.IDPaths
```

## Docker

Buf ships a Docker image, [`bufbuild/buf`][image], that enables you to use `buf`
as part of your Docker workflows. Here's an example of using the image to run
`buf generate`:

```terminal
$ docker run \
  --volume "$(pwd):/workspace" \
  --workdir /workspace \
  bufbuild/buf generate
```

:::info Docker image doesn't include protoc or plugins

1. Use [remote plugins](../bsr/remote-packages/overview.mdx#remote-plugins) to
generate code without requiring local plugins.
1. Use [generated assets](../bsr/remote-packages/overview.mdx) to fetch
generated code stubs without needing to install any additional executables.
1. Use the `bufbuild/buf` image as part of a [multi-stage build][multi-stage]
that includes any required executables as part of the final image.
