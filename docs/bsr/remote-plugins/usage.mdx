> We highly recommend completing [the tour](../../tutorials/getting-started-with-buf-cli.md#generate-code) to
> get an overview of `buf generate` with remote plugins.

## Configuration

The `buf.gen.yaml` file controls how the `buf generate` command executes
Protobuf plugins for any [input](../../reference/inputs.md). Here, we can
specify [remote plugins](overview.mdx) to perform code generation. For more
information on the `buf.gen.yaml` configuration, see the
[reference](../../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md).

Buf verifies and maintains the commonly-used plugins used across the Protobuf
ecosystem. To discover all publicly-available plugins, go to
[buf.build/plugins](https://buf.build/plugins).

## Choose your input

Remote plugins generate code for [inputs](../../reference/inputs.md). An input
can be a git repository, tarball, zip file, a or local directory containing
Protobuf files configured with a
[`buf.yaml`](../../configuration/v1/buf-yaml.md) configuration file. Buf refers
to such directories of Protobuf files as [modules](../overview.mdx#modules).

For our purposes, we'll assume you have a `buf.yaml` in your current directory
that defines a module. To create a `buf.yaml` in your current directory.

```terminal
$ buf mod init
```

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1
breaking:
  use:
    - FILE
lint:
  use:
    - DEFAULT
```

See the [build](../../build/usage.md) documentation for full details on how to
configure modules to build with `buf`.

## Create a [`buf.gen.yaml`](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml)

Now that you have an [input](../../reference/inputs.md) to generate code for, we
need to define a [`buf.gen.yaml`](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml) and specify
what `protoc` plugins you want to use.

A remote plugin can be pinned to a specific version, or if you want to always
use the latest version of the plugin, the version can be omitted. Here's some
examples for common languages and RPC frameworks:

import GenYaml from "./_gen-yaml.mdx";

<GenYaml />

Note, we're using the `plugin` key to reference a remote plugin. More
information can be
[found in the buf.gen.yaml docs](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml#plugin-name-or-remote).

Plugins are invoked in the order they are specified in your `buf.gen.yaml` with
results from each invocation combined before writing the result. For more
information, see the
[`buf.gen.yaml` reference](../../configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml.md).

> As a best practice, when referencing remote, plugins we recommend including
> the version of the plugin to ensure reproducible code generation. It is
> possible to reference both local and remote plugins within a single template
> file.

## Run generate

To generate using the module and `buf.gen.yaml` defined in your current
directory:

```terminal
$ buf generate
```

The `buf generate` command will:

- Send the Protobuf files specified in your input to the Buf Schema Registry
  remote plugin executor.
- Invoke each plugin specified in your `buf.gen.yaml`.
- Send the results back, and unpack them on your local file system.

By default, `buf generate` looks for a
[`buf.gen.yaml`](/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml) in your current directory. An
alternate location can be specified by usin the `--template` flag:

```terminal
$ buf generate --template templates/buf.go.gen.yaml
```

You can also run `buf generate`. For example if all of your `.proto` files are
in directory `foo`:

```terminal
# generate using the module defined in the foo/ directory
$ buf generate foo
# generate using the files contained in the root directory
# of the github.com/acme/weather repository on the default branch
$ buf generate https://github.com/acme/weather.git
# generate using the buf.gen.yaml file at templates/buf.go.gen.yaml
# using the files in the buf.build/grpc/grpc module
$ buf generate --template templates/buf.go.gen.yaml buf.build/acme/petapis
```

If you used one of the example `buf.gen.yaml` files from above, you should end
up with this file structure:

import Tree from "./_tree.mdx";

<Tree />

## Common use cases

### protoc-gen-go

[`protoc-gen-go`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go) generates
message and enum stubs for Golang. The BSR hosts this plugin at
[buf.build/protocolbuffers/go](https://buf.build/protocolbuffers/go).

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml" {3}
version: v1
plugins:
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

### protoc-gen-go + protoc-gen-validate

[`protoc-gen-validate`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protoc-gen-validate) is a
plugin that generates polyglot message validators. The BSR hosts this plugin
pre-enabled for Go code generation at
[buf.build/bufbuild/validate-go](https://buf.build/bufbuild/validate-go).

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml" {4,8}
version: v1
plugins:
  # The protoc-gen-go stubs are required for grpc-go
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  - plugin: buf.build/bufbuild/validate-go
    # Make sure to generate your protoc-gen-validate code to the same
    # directory as protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

### grpc-go

[`protoc-gen-go-grpc`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/tree/master/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc)
generates Golang service stubs for gRPC. The BSR hosts this plugin at
[buf.build/grpc/go](https://buf.build/grpc/go). Note that we'd recommend
checking out connect-go instead of using grpc-go (see the next section).

```yaml title="buf.gen.yaml" {4,8}
version: v1
plugins:
  # The protoc-gen-go stubs are required for grpc-go
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  - plugin: buf.build/grpc/go
    # Make sure to generate your grpc-go code to the same
    # directory as protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go-grpc
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

### connect-go

[Connect-Go](https://connect.build/docs/go/getting-started)
is a slim library for building browser and
gRPC-compatible HTTP APIs. Handlers and clients support three protocols: gRPC,
gRPC-Web, and Connect's own protocol.

[`protoc-gen-connect-go`](https://github.com/bufbuild/connect-go) generates
Golang service stubs for Connect. The BSR hosts this plugin at
[buf.build/bufbuild/connect-go](https://buf.build/bufbuild/connect-go).

```yaml title=buf.gen.yaml {4,8}
version: v1
plugins:
  # The protoc-gen-go stubs are required for grpc-go
  - plugin: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
  - plugin: buf.build/bufbuild/connect-go
    # Unlike grpc-go, connect stubs do not need to be generated to the
    # same directory, however you are free to do so
    out: gen/go
    # You almost always want to set this option with protoc-gen-connect-go
    opt: paths=source_relative
```

### connect-web

[Connect-Web](https://connect.build/docs/web/getting-started) is a simple
library to call remote procedures from a web browser. Unlike REST, you get a
type-safe client and never have to think about serialization again.

[`protoc-gen-connect-web`](https://github.com/bufbuild/connect-web) generates
client service stubs for TypeScript and JavaScript. It requires the
[`protoc-gen-es`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es) plugin to generate
message and service stubs. The code those two plugins generate requires the
runtime libraries
[`@bufbuild/connect-web`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/connect-web),
and [`@bufbuild/protobuf`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protobuf).

The BSR hosts these plugins at
[buf.build/bufbuild/connect-web](https://buf.build/bufbuild/connect-web) and
[buf.build/bufbuild/es](https://buf.build/bufbuild/es).

```yaml title=buf.gen.yaml {3,5}
version: v1
plugins:
  - plugin: buf.build/bufbuild/es
    out: gen/es
  - plugin: buf.build/bufbuild/connect-web
    out: gen/es
```

### connect-swift

[Connect-Swift](https://connect.build/docs/swift/getting-started)
is a small library that provides support for using generated,
type-safe, and idiomatic Swift APIs to communicate with your app's servers.
It can be used with both the gRPC-Web and Connect protocols.

[`protoc-gen-connect-swift`](https://github.com/bufbuild/connect-swift)
is responsible for generating Swift clients, and relies on the models generated
by [`protoc-gen-swift`](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf).
The BSR hosts both of these plugins at
[buf.build/bufbuild/connect-swift](https://buf.build/bufbuild/connect-swift)
and [buf.build/apple/swift](https://buf.build/apple/swift), respectively.

To get started with Connect-Swift, check out the
[demo tutorial](https://connect.build/docs/swift/getting-started).

```yaml title=buf.gen.yaml {3,6}
version: v1
plugins:
  - plugin: buf.build/apple/swift
    opt: Visibility=Public
    out: gen/swift
  - plugin: buf.build/bufbuild/connect-swift
    opt: Visibility=Public
    out: gen/swift
```
